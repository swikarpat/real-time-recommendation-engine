# Real-Time Recommendation Engine Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the real-time recommendation engine. The system is designed to provide personalized product recommendations to users of an e-commerce platform.

## Components

The system comprises the following key components:

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Handles real-time and batch data ingestion from various sources.
    *   Uses Kafka for real-time streaming of user events (clicks, purchases).
    *   Uses batch jobs to load data like product catalogs.

2.  **Data Storage:**
    *   Uses a data lake (S3) to store raw data.
    *   Uses a data warehouse (Redshift/Snowflake) to store processed data and features.

3.  **Data Processing:**
    *   Uses Spark for batch processing and feature engineering.
    *   Uses Flink/Spark Streaming for real-time feature extraction and user profile updates.
    *   (Optional) Uses a feature store to manage and serve features.

4.  **Model Training:**
    *   Trains recommendation models (e.g., DeepFM) using Spark and TensorFlow/PyTorch.
    *   Uses Horovod for distributed training.

5.  **Model Serving:**
    *   Deploys trained models for real-time inference using a custom inference service or a platform like SageMaker

6.  **Recommendation API:**
    *   Provides a REST API (using FastAPI) to serve recommendations to client applications.

7.  **Orchestration:**
    *   Uses Airflow to orchestrate data pipelines and model training workflows.

8.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Uses Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring system health, performance, and data quality.
    *   Uses CloudWatch for monitoring AWS resources.
