# Real-Time Recommendation Engine Runbook

This document provides guidelines for troubleshooting and maintaining the real-time recommendation engine.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1.  **Problem:** Recommendations are not updating in real-time.

    *   **Possible Causes:**
        *   Issues with the Kafka consumers.
        *   Problems with the real-time processing application (Flink/Spark Streaming).
        *   Connectivity problems between components.

    *   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
        *   Check the logs of the Kafka consumers for any errors.
        *   Check the logs of the Flink/Spark Streaming application.
        *   Verify that Kafka brokers are running and accessible.
        *   Check network connectivity between components.
        *   Use monitoring dashboards (Grafana) to identify bottlenecks or errors.

2.  **Problem:** API is slow to respond.

    *   **Possible Causes:**
        *   High load on the API.
        *   Slow inference from the model serving layer.
        *   Inefficient database queries.
        *   Network latency.

    *   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
        *   Check the API server logs.
        *   Monitor API response times using Grafana dashboards.
        *   Check the load and performance of the model serving infrastructure.
        *   Optimize database queries if necessary.
        *   Use a caching layer (Redis) to reduce latency.

3.  **Problem:** Model accuracy is degrading.

    *   **Possible Causes:**
        *   Data drift (changes in user behavior or data distribution).
        *   Concept drift (changes in the relationship between features and the target variable).
        *   Issues with the model training pipeline.

    *   **Troubleshooting Steps:**
        *   Monitor model performance metrics (AUC, precision, recall) using dashboards.
        *   Retrain the model more frequently.
        *   Investigate data quality issues.
        *   Consider using more advanced models or features.

### Monitoring and Alerting

*   **Monitoring:** The system is monitored using Prometheus and Grafana. Dashboards are available to visualize key metrics.
*   **Alerting:** Alerts are configured for critical issues, such as:
    *   High error rates in the API or data pipelines.
    *   High latency in the API or model serving.
    *   Low resource utilization (CPU, memory) indicating potential bottlenecks.
    *   Significant drops in model accuracy.

### Maintenance

*   **Regular Tasks:**
    *   Monitor system performance and resource utilization.
    *   Review logs for errors and warnings.
    *   Update dependencies and patch software vulnerabilities.
    *   Retrain models periodically.
*   **Data Pipeline Maintenance:**
    *   Ensure data pipelines are running smoothly.
    *   Monitor data quality and address any issues.
*   **Model Maintenance:**
    *   Retrain models with fresh data.
    *   Evaluate model performance and consider improvements.
*   **Infrastructure Maintenance:**
    *   Monitor and manage cloud resources (e.g., S3, EMR, Redshift, SageMaker).
    *   Scale resources up or down as needed.
