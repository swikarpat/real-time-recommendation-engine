# Placeholder: This script would contain commands to deploy your model to AWS SageMaker
# It would involve steps like:
# 1. Creating a SageMaker model from your trained model artifact.
# 2. Creating an endpoint configuration.
# 3. Deploying the model to an endpoint.

# Example (using AWS CLI):
# aws sagemaker create-model ...
# aws sagemaker create-endpoint-config ...
# aws sagemaker create-endpoint ...
